Playground mode (RFC-0036): `createApi({ playground: { info } })` answers every request as the fixed `PLAYGROUND_PRINCIPAL` (an Editor with site settings and nothing installation-wide or upload-related), refuses blocked routes with `403 {error: "playground"}` through the pure `isBlockedInPlayground(method, path)` guard (also exported for the playground Worker), limits request bodies, and reports `features.playground` in `/api/instance`. Every declared route is either blocked or allowed, and a route on neither list is refused. Studio shows a session bar (time left, Reset, Deploy to Cloudflare) and leaves out team, agent and account screens on a playground.
