`cloudhal deploy` runs in Cloudflare Workers Builds (`WORKERS_CI=1`), so a Deploy to Cloudflare button can set up a whole installation (docs/guides/deploy-button.md). Names come from the committed `wrangler.jsonc`, and a database id there is used without any D1 call. The starter site is seeded under `cloudhal.json`'s `siteId` when the checkout has none. Secrets stay on the Workers: only missing ones are generated, and the deployment token is new on every build. The setup link is never printed; the first build explains how the owner sets their own setup token. `seedStarterSite` takes an optional `siteId`.
