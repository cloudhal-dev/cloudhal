A `CLOUDHAL_DEPLOY_TOKEN` shorter than 32 characters no longer makes every `/api` request fail with 500. Only `/api/admin` is disabled (503 `deploy_token_invalid`): the error is logged once, `/api/health` reports `problems: ["deploy_token_invalid"]`, and sign-in and Studio keep working. The Workers Builds setup steps and the Deploy button guide now say not to edit `CLOUDHAL_DEPLOY_TOKEN`, because every build replaces it.
