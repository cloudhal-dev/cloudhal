Collection permalinks, step 3 (RFC-0038 §5): Studio's Site settings has a Collections section, one row per collection with the URL prefix before `/{slug}` and a real entry's address; saving goes through the site update, which writes the permanent redirect, and a path conflict shows on the row. The new MCP tool `set_collection_permalink` (`site:write`) moves a collection's URLs and always waits for a person, in every mode, with a prompt listing the old and new template, example entries' old and new URLs and the redirect; `dryRun: true` returns that plan without changing anything, and overlaps are refused before anyone is asked. `get_site` documents `collections`. `SiteGraphStore.updateSite(site, { dryRun: true })` runs every check without writing. A menu item for a collection links to a published page at the collection's permalink prefix when there is one, before the page that lists the collection. The blog starter's README describes collection permalinks. Only someone who may change site settings (`site:settings`) approves it: tool policies take a new `approverScopes`.
