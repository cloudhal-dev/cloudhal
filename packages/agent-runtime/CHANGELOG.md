### Minor Changes

- 3e93878: Collections stage 3 in the renderer (RFC-0042 step 3, ADR-0044). A collection's `expiry` gives every entry a derived gate (`min(availability.until, field date + grace)`; a date ends at the next day's start in the site's zone), applied by both published sources at render time: `unlist` keeps the entry's page but leaves `entries()`, `allEntries()`, term filters and archives, related posts, feeds, the sitemap, `llms.txt` and search (search rows' `gateUntil`); `hide` answers 404 like an expired `availability`. The gate index adds every derived instant and every value instant of date/datetime list fields, so the edge cache expires there without a purge; previews ignore derived gates and say "Ended on …". New theme APIs: `GraphSource.queryEntries` and `queryEntries(source, q)` (`./queries`) list a collection by its list fields (`where`, `orderBy`, `sort`, `filter`, `limit`, `offset`, `includeExpired`) with one evaluator on live and snapshot sources; `contentListEntries`; `GraphSource.routableEntries` (entries with a public URL, unlisted included); `withStructuredData` and `entryStructuredData` (`./seo`) replace the generic `BlogPosting` with the collection's JSON-LD preset when the entry has every required value. `ContentList.astro` honours `where`/`orderBy`, also for theme copies that pass a source's list. `entryHead` is unchanged, so old themes keep today's output; the blog starter calls `withStructuredData` and `contentListEntries`. The site Worker's `GET /__cloudhal/features` answers `{ "gates": 2 }`, and writers (store, API, MCP, bundle import) refuse a new or changed `expiry` with `409 gates_unsupported` until it does (`GateSupport.enforced(siteId, version)`, `EXPIRY_GATES_VERSION`). A live entry whose published change adds a derived gate or moves it earlier is never low risk in `auto` mode (`expiringEntries`, auto-check code `expires`, for publishes and releases). Sites without the new settings render as before.

### Patch Changes

- 4cd475d: Collection permalinks, step 3 (RFC-0038 §5): Studio's Site settings has a Collections section, one row per collection with the URL prefix before `/{slug}` and a real entry's address; saving goes through the site update, which writes the permanent redirect, and a path conflict shows on the row. The new MCP tool `set_collection_permalink` (`site:write`) moves a collection's URLs and always waits for a person, in every mode, with a prompt listing the old and new template, example entries' old and new URLs and the redirect; `dryRun: true` returns that plan without changing anything, and overlaps are refused before anyone is asked. `get_site` documents `collections`. `SiteGraphStore.updateSite(site, { dryRun: true })` runs every check without writing. A menu item for a collection links to a published page at the collection's permalink prefix when there is one, before the page that lists the collection. The blog starter's README describes collection permalinks. Only someone who may change site settings (`site:settings`) approves it: tool policies take a new `approverScopes`.
