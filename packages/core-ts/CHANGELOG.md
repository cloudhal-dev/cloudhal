# @cloudhal/core-ts

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 7223152: `importSite` (behind `cloudhal pull`, the admin bundle route `cloudhal push` uses, and `cloudhal import`) now checks a bundle's project row before inserting it: it must be the site node's project (`projectId`), a valid Project, with its `id` and `rev` columns matching its body. Before, a bundle could plant any projects row.
- d91ef8f: Dependency patch updates (#115). `@cloudhal/api` depends on Better Auth 1.7.12 and on exactly the versions it uses itself: `@better-auth/core` and `@better-auth/api-key` 1.7.12, `@better-auth/utils` 0.5.0 and `better-call` 1.4.4. `@cloudhal/cloudflare` asks for zod ^4.6.7 (GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5 is fixed in 4.6.6). `@cloudhal/core-ts` and `@cloudhal/astro-renderer` use marked ^18.1.1. `@cloudhal/core-ts` and `@cloudhal/schedules` use temporal-polyfill 1.0.6. `@cloudhal/astro-renderer` uses vite ^8.3.5. The Studio shipped in `@cloudhal/cli` is built with React 19.3.1, TanStack Router 1.170.46 and TanStack Query 5.104.5. marked 18.1.1 splits a few unusual markdown inputs differently: a blockquote ends before an unquoted line that follows a heading, rule or HTML block, and indented HTML blocks interrupt a paragraph. A stored body like that keeps rendering and shows virtual block ids until its next write.
- f73d05a: RFC-0042 §4, #110: `queryContentEntries` (the API's `GET /entries?where=…`, Studio's lists, MCP `list_entries`) answers `where`, `orderBy`, status, locale, `limit` and `offset` in SQL from the new `entry_list_values` side table once a collection is ready, instead of reading and evaluating the whole collection; results are the shared evaluator's, which stays the fallback (term filters, collections not ready, operands SQL cannot compare exactly) and the oracle of a seeded property suite on SQLite, D1 and Durable Object SQLite. On the 10,000-entry benchmark the store path drops from 124 ms CPU / 10,001 rows (SQLite) and 176 ms / 10,003 rows read (D1) to 0.6 ms / 22 rows and 5.3 ms / 5,068 rows read; a page at offset 4,980 costs about the same as the first.
  
  The store keeps the table exact. Entry creates, updates, moves and deletes write an entry's rows (its `listFields` values as `resolveFields` reads them) in their own batch, and an original's write rewrites its same-site translations' rows; site writes and field operations that change a collection's list definitions reset its readiness in the same batch, and imports reset the site's. A race never refuses a write: it marks the collection not ready. New `rebuildListValues(sql, options)` is the resumable, budgeted backfill (guarded per chunk, safe to run concurrently; `budget.statements` bounds every statement it issues, `start` rotates where a run begins, `tidy` removes rows of unlisted collections); `updateSite`, finished field operations and `importSite` run it for what they reset, and `openLocalStore` runs it on open. A field operation's revert resets every listed collection whose values its restored bodies change. `deleteContentEntry` behaves as before.
  
  `revertTagsToTerms` now leaves an entry that was edited after the migration's before-snapshot (by a concurrent write, or before a resumed run) as it is and reports it in `edited`, instead of restoring its earlier fields, status or collection.
- f669266: `importSite`, used by `cloudhal pull`, by the admin bundle route `cloudhal push` uses, and by `cloudhal import`, now runs every check before it writes anything, the bootstrap conflict and the 1000-statement limit included, and plans the media ledger with them. A refused bundle leaves the target as it was; before, node bodies could land ahead of a conflict and snapshots ahead of the size limit. Only a storage failure can stop it between its writes, and importing the bundle again completes it. New checks, each before the first write:
  
  - Every node body the target lacks must be a valid contract document of the kind of each snapshot ref that points to it, with that ref's id and rev, of the bundle's site (precompiled validators). A body no snapshot references is refused. Before, a body was only checked against its hash, so a crafted bundle could put invalid content behind the published snapshot.
  - Node and snapshot ids may not belong to another site of the target, each appears once, and no two nodes share a kind and key or a translation group and locale (the node batch's unique keys).
  - Every takedown entry has its fields with their types (`reason`, `legal`, `by`, `at`).
  - The media ledger (`snapshot_blobs`) reads the target's own asset bodies, never the bundle's text for a body the target already holds.
  
  New `planImport(to, bundle, options)` returns what an import would change, without writing:
  
  - the nodes added, changed and removed;
  - the snapshots and node bodies to add;
  - whether the project row is new;
  - the listed media that are present, missing, of another size or taken down on the target;
  - the bundle's takedowns, those whose bytes the target holds (an import deletes them) and those its ledger does not hold yet.
  
  With `report: true` it returns a bootstrap conflict and missing media instead of throwing them. A node body that is not JSON is refused as `blob <hash> is not JSON` instead of with the parser's message.
- 786a455: New `restoreBundle(from, snapshot)`: a site bundle of one snapshot's nodes, rebuilt from the stored node bodies, for `importSite(…, { mode: "replace" })`, which checks it like any bundle. The site's working copy and published pointer become that snapshot's again (`cloudhal import --revert`, RFC-0039). Revs only move forward: a node the site holds at the snapshot's rev or a later one, with other content, comes back at the rev after its current one, so a Studio tab or agent still holding a rev that node had gets a conflict instead of saving over it; a node whose content already is the snapshot's is left as it is. It lists the media those nodes need and carries the store's takedowns among them, so taken-down content stays down; a missing node body, or one that is not the node its snapshot ref names, is refused before anything is written. `exportSite`'s output is unchanged.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 40dbfcb: Gaps an agent hit building a site through MCP:
  
  - **Section-only theme blocks in article bodies are refused.** A theme block type with `where: ["section"]` (say `link-cards`) has no component in an article, and drew "unknown component" there. `create_entry`/`update_entry` now refuse it inside a body ```` ```surface ```` fence (`invalid_surface`, with the component's path); primitives, built-in blocks and theme blocks that allow `body` stay. `get_catalog`'s "In article bodies" lists which blocks a body may use and which are page sections only.
  - **`list_entries` lists every collection by default**, not only `posts`: a site whose articles live in `blog` got `[]`. `where`/`orderBy` need the collection whose list fields they use; without one they are refused (`invalid_query` at `collection`) instead of ignored.
  - **`long-line` gives a text column one verdict.** It counted characters over a rounded line count, so how full a paragraph's last line was decided whether it passed, and identical paragraphs in one column disagreed. It now counts the characters on each rendered line, leaves each paragraph's last line out, and pools the paragraphs of one width and font: one example per column, with its width and how many paragraphs it holds.
  - **Blog starter:** a primary surface `Button` in an article body keeps its `on-brand` text; the body's link colour no longer applies to buttons (it failed contrast at 2.5:1 light, 1.3:1 dark).
- 028f396: A collection's template may now sit on top of a page at its prefix: `set_collection_permalink` with `posts` → `/blog/{slug}` no longer fails with `path_conflict` because a page lives at `/blog`. That page is the collection's index page (RFC-0038), so only pages strictly under the prefix conflict, in the template check, its SQL race guard (`noPageUnder`) and the reverse check on page writes. Studio's "Create listing page" now works for a collection with its own permalink too.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 321e8be: Collections stage 3 contract and pure core (RFC-0042 step 1, ADR-0044). `CollectionSettings` gains optional `listFields` (up to 4 field keys), `expiry` (`{ field, action: "unlist" | "hide", afterMinutes? }`) and `structuredData` (`{ type: "Event" | "JobPosting" | "Product" | "Recipe", properties }`, each property sourced by `kind`: `field`, `entry`, `site` or a plain-text `text` constant); `contentList` sections gain `where` (up to 4 `FieldCondition`s) and `orderBy` (`FieldOrder`), both new in `common.schema.json`. New `@cloudhal/core-ts/structured-data`: the closed preset table, `checkStructuredData` (save-time mapping check) and `structuredDataFor` (an entry's JSON-LD, none when a required value is missing, capped at 32 KB). `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields` adds the listing evaluator (`checkFieldQuery`, `parseFieldQuery`, `matchesFieldQuery`, `compareByField`) and the derived expiry gate (`fieldGateInstant`, `expiryInstant`, `effectiveUntil`, `dayStartIn`). Nothing reads them yet: no behaviour change.
- 3e93878: Collections stage 3 in the renderer (RFC-0042 step 3, ADR-0044). A collection's `expiry` gives every entry a derived gate (`min(availability.until, field date + grace)`; a date ends at the next day's start in the site's zone), applied by both published sources at render time: `unlist` keeps the entry's page but leaves `entries()`, `allEntries()`, term filters and archives, related posts, feeds, the sitemap, `llms.txt` and search (search rows' `gateUntil`); `hide` answers 404 like an expired `availability`. The gate index adds every derived instant and every value instant of date/datetime list fields, so the edge cache expires there without a purge; previews ignore derived gates and say "Ended on …". New theme APIs: `GraphSource.queryEntries` and `queryEntries(source, q)` (`./queries`) list a collection by its list fields (`where`, `orderBy`, `sort`, `filter`, `limit`, `offset`, `includeExpired`) with one evaluator on live and snapshot sources; `contentListEntries`; `GraphSource.routableEntries` (entries with a public URL, unlisted included); `withStructuredData` and `entryStructuredData` (`./seo`) replace the generic `BlogPosting` with the collection's JSON-LD preset when the entry has every required value. `ContentList.astro` honours `where`/`orderBy`, also for theme copies that pass a source's list. `entryHead` is unchanged, so old themes keep today's output; the blog starter calls `withStructuredData` and `contentListEntries`. The site Worker's `GET /__cloudhal/features` answers `{ "gates": 2 }`, and writers (store, API, MCP, bundle import) refuse a new or changed `expiry` with `409 gates_unsupported` until it does (`GateSupport.enforced(siteId, version)`, `EXPIRY_GATES_VERSION`). A live entry whose published change adds a derived gate or moves it earlier is never low risk in `auto` mode (`expiringEntries`, auto-check code `expires`, for publishes and releases). Sites without the new settings render as before.
- 90d0828: Collections stage 3 in the store and the API (RFC-0042 step 2, ADR-0044). `updateSite` checks the new collection settings when they change: `listFields` and `expiry.field` name fields of the collection (`unknown_field`), the expiry field is a date or datetime field (`invalid_expiry`), and a structured-data preset passes `checkStructuredData` (`structured_data_invalid`; warnings are not refused). Unlisting, dropping or retyping a list field, or dropping a select option, that `contentList` sections still filter or sort by is refused as `list_field_in_use` naming the pages, kept true by a guard on the site CAS. Page writes check changed `contentList` `where`/`orderBy` against the collection's list fields (`invalid_query`, with `sections/<i>/…` paths). Field operations follow: `rename_field` renames the field in `listFields`, `expiry`, structured-data sources and sections' queries in phase A's batch (and back on revert); `remove_field` refuses while any of them names the field; `change_field_type` refuses when the new type would break them. New `queryContentEntries` (and `applyFieldQuery`) filters and orders a collection's entries by list fields with the shared evaluator over resolved values. `GET /api/sites/:id/entries` takes `where` (JSON), `orderBy` (JSON), `limit` (1–100) and `cursor`; with `limit` it answers `{ entries, total, nextCursor? }`, without it the plain array as before. New error codes `invalid_query`, `structured_data_invalid`, `invalid_expiry` (422) and `list_field_in_use` (409). Sites without the new settings behave as before.

### Patch Changes

- 84c6d94: Typed fields follow-ups (RFC-0041). One asset check for field values, `fieldAssetIssues` in `@cloudhal/core-ts/media` (with `fieldAssetRefs` and `newFieldAssetRefs`), now used by both the store's entry write and MCP's `create_entry`/`update_entry` precheck; same codes and messages. Machine translation now follows §5: `get_translation_source` returns only the localized text and rich-text field values to translate (`fields`) and names the shared ones (`sharedFields`); `save_translation` takes translated `fields`, refuses shared ones in precheck with `field_not_localized` (paths in `details.issues`), and no longer copies the source's field values into a new translation in the same site. New helpers in `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields`: `localizedFieldValues`, `translatableFieldValues`, `sharedFieldKeys`, `sharedFieldIssues`. Studio's "write by hand" draft copies only localized field values.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 672b993: Typed custom fields, step 1 (RFC-0041 / ADR-0043). `Site.collections.<key>.fields` takes an ordered list of 1–30 field definitions in nine types (`text`, `richText`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `url`, `image`, `select`), discriminated by `type`, each with per-locale labels, `localized` and (except `boolean`) `requiredToPublish`. The new `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields` subpath (Worker-safe, eval-free) checks definitions (reserved keys, unique keys and options, 30 per collection, 200 per site, 256 KB of collection settings, the plain-edit guard), checks values through ADR-0030's `validateProps` (only changed values; unknown keys refused once a collection has definitions; 256 KB per entry), checks `requiredToPublish`, emits the JSON Schema agents receive (strict-mode safe), and resolves values across translations (`resolveFields`). Nothing reads it yet: the store, API, MCP, Studio and renderer adopt it in later steps, so nothing changes for existing sites.
- cc263c3: Typed custom fields, step 3 (RFC-0041 §6 / ADR-0043): field operations.
  
  - **`runFieldOperation` / `continueFieldOperation` / `revertFieldOperation` / `fieldOperationStatus`** in `@cloudhal/core-ts` run `rename_field`, `change_field_type`, `set_field_localized` and `remove_field`: a dry run (entries touched, values moved, converted, cleared, removed, unchanged and unconvertible, per locale, with samples), a `before …` snapshot whose id is the operation id, the new definition with its `migration` marker (phase A), entries rewritten in guarded batches of 200 that resume after an interruption (phase B), the marker dropped once nothing is pending (phase C) and an `after` snapshot. Only the draft graph changes. A type change follows a closed conversion table (`convertFieldValue`, exported from `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields`) and refuses values it cannot convert (`field_values_unconvertible`) unless `onInvalid: "clear"`. One operation per collection at a time (`operation_in_progress`). Reverting restores the earlier definition and the entries nobody edited since, and converts edited ones back.
  - **Readers stay consistent mid-run:** `resolveFields` converts values still in the old type, and a field being removed reads as gone; a person's entry write during an operation goes through the marker, so edits and the operation converge.
  - **Translations:** changing only non-localized field values of an original no longer marks its translations stale (their recorded source hash follows, in the same batch); operations keep fresh translations fresh.
  - **API:** `POST /api/sites/:id/collections/:key/fields/operations` (`dryRun`, `?continue=<id>`), `GET …/:operationId`, `POST …/:operationId/revert` (`site:settings` and `content:write`), and the same under `/api/admin` with the deployment token.
  - **CLI:** `cloudhal fields rename|retype|localize|remove|continue|revert [--dry-run] [--remote]`; the dry run also lists theme files that read the field directly.
- 92d3362: Typed custom fields, step 6 (RFC-0041 §9 / ADR-0043): renderer and themes. Additive only: `entry.fields` still means exactly what is stored, and themes copied before this release build and render as before (a frozen 0.4.0 theme joins the compat test).
  
  - **`GraphSource.entryFields(entry, options?)`** on live and snapshot sources (and `entryFields(source, entry, options?)` from `@cloudhal/astro-renderer/fields` for any source): an entry's typed fields as a theme draws them, by key in definition order. Values are resolved by the language rules (a translation's empty localized field reads the original's, `fromOriginal`; non-localized fields come from the translation group's original; language editions own their values), labelled in the page's language and made safe: rich text as HTML from the article body's markdown pipeline (raw HTML escaped, `safeHref` on links), URLs through `safeHref` (dropped when unsafe), images as `<img>` attributes with the asset's alt in the page's language, everything else as formatted text. Also `renderFields`, `hasShownFields`, and `resolveFields`, `formatFieldValue`, `fieldLabel`, `fieldHelp`, `optionLabel` re-exported.
  - **`formatFieldValue(value, def, { locale, defaultLocale?, timeZone?, words? })`** in `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields`: a value as plain text with `Intl` (numbers, dates that never shift a day, instants in their own zone, option labels as a list, yes/no words).
  - **`EntryFields.astro`** in `@cloudhal/astro-renderer/components`: a plain, unstyled `<dl class="ch-fields">` of the fields that have a value, with `data-field` / `data-type` hooks for themes; nothing at all when none has one.
  - **Blog starter:** articles of collections with fields show a "Details" list under the cover (English, Turkish and Japanese words). Entries of collections without definitions render byte for byte as before.
  - New guide: `docs/guides/fields.md` (defining fields in Studio, MCP, the API and the CLI; operations; languages; theme API; security).
- bd5af88: Typed custom fields, step 2 (RFC-0041 / ADR-0043): the store and the API enforce field definitions.
  
  - **Site writes** (`updateSite`, `createSite`, `PUT /api/sites/:id/collections/:key`, dry run included) check definitions: reserved (`field_key_reserved`) and duplicate keys or options, `minimum` above `maximum`, 30 fields per collection and 200 per site (`too_many_fields`), 256 KB of collection settings (`too_large`). A plain edit never loses a value: changing a field's `type`, `localized` or `multiple`, or dropping a key or a select option that an entry still holds, is refused with `409 field_change_needs_operation`, naming the field operation to use. Other site writes do not re-run the checks.
  - **Entry writes** check only the field values that changed: `422 invalid_fields`, `unknown_field` (a new key without a definition, once the collection has definitions; stored unknown keys are kept), `field_not_localized` (a translation's own copy of a non-localized value) and `required_field` (review or published without a `requiredToPublish` value; drafts save freely). `fields` is capped at 256 KB per entry in every collection when it changes (`too_large`). Image values must be image assets of the site, and image and rich-text asset references are recorded in `asset_refs` under `fields.<key>`, so a used file cannot be deleted. Every refusal lists its problems with paths in `details.issues` (`fields/startsAt/at`).
  - **API inputs** remove a key with `null` in a collection that has definitions. Collections without definitions keep `fields` as any JSON, exactly as before.
  - **Search**: `text` and `richText` fields marked `searchable` add their words to the entry's search text at the next publish (off by default; sites without searchable fields index byte for byte as before).
  - `refuseFieldIssues` and `fieldRefusalCode` are exported from `@cloudhal/core-ts/fields`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c287a09: First-class collections, step 1 (RFC-0040 / ADR-0042). `Site.collections.<key>` takes optional `labels` (singular and plural per locale), `icon`, `feed`, `sitemap` and `sort` next to `permalink`, with at most 50 collections per site. `SiteGraphStore.listCollections(siteId)` returns the registry: declared collections, those inferred from existing entries, and `posts`, with entry counts per status. The new `@cloudhal/core-ts/collections` subpath adds `collectionLabel` and `collectionSettings` for themes. Nothing changes for existing sites.
- 3c4453e: First-class collections, step 2 (RFC-0040 / ADR-0042).
  - **Store:** the first entry of a new collection is refused (`path_conflict`, `reserved_path`) when its default prefix `/<collection>` overlaps another collection's permalink, a taxonomy archive, `/search` or a locale prefix. This closes the gap RFC-0038 left. A site update that declares a new collection runs the same check, and a declared collection that still has entries, or that a taxonomy names, cannot be undeclared (`collection_in_use`).
  - **API:** new routes under `/api/sites/:id/collections`:
    - `GET` (`content:read`) lists the registry;
    - `PUT /:key { settings, rev }` declares or changes a collection (`site:settings`), with `?dryRun=1`;
    - `DELETE /:key?rev=` undeclares an empty one.
  
    Creating an entry in a collection outside the registry is refused with `collection_undeclared` (422).
  - **Renderer:** RSS feeds leave out collections with `feed: false`, and `sitemap.xml` leaves out those with `sitemap: false`. The defaults are unchanged. `collectionLabel` and `collectionSettings` are re-exported from `./routing` for themes.
  - **MCP:** resetting a permalink with `set_collection_permalink` keeps the collection declared. Agents get hints for the new error codes.

## 0.3.13

### Patch Changes

- 6a39c6d: Fix: sites whose theme was copied from the starter before 0.3.11 rendered empty pages (200 with no body). Their `EntryList` calls the renderer's old one-argument `entryPath(entry)` (and `.map(entryPath)`), which became `entryPath(site, entry)` in 0.3.11. `entryPath` accepts the old call again (deprecated; it ignores collection permalinks — pass the site to get them).

## 0.3.12

### Patch Changes

- 84d1fc3: `@cloudhal/core-ts/locale-paths`: the locale URL helpers (`localeRouting`, `localizedPath`, `localeUrl`) move from the renderer into core-ts, browser-safe, with `itemUrl(site, origin, item)` for a page's or entry's public URL. `@cloudhal/astro-renderer/locales` re-exports them unchanged.
- @cloudhal/core-contracts@0.3.12
  - @cloudhal/schedules@0.3.12
  - @cloudhal/storage@0.3.12

## 0.3.11

### Patch Changes

- 55deb41: RFC-0038 step 1: `Site.collections.<key>.permalink` in the contracts (a template, `/blog/{slug}`; v1 is fixed segments plus `{slug}`), and `entryPath(site, entry)` / `entryAt(site, path)` in `@cloudhal/core-ts` (also `@cloudhal/core-ts/permalinks`). Every entry URL in the renderer, starter, API, MCP server, CLI and Studio now comes from them; with no `collections` set, every URL is the same as before. The renderer's one-argument `entryPath(entry)` is replaced by core's `entryPath(site, entry)` (re-exported from `@cloudhal/astro-renderer/routing`); themes pass the site, or `MediaContext.permalinks`.
- 2d0a257: Collection permalinks, step 2 (RFC-0038 §3–§4): changing a collection's permalink in a site update adds a prefix redirect from the old URL prefix to the new one, in every locale and in the same batch as the site update. A template may not overlap another collection, a taxonomy archive, a page or a reserved path (`path_conflict`/`reserved_path`), and pages and archives may not be created inside a configured prefix. The search index rewrites entry links on the next publish.
- 4cd475d: Collection permalinks, step 3 (RFC-0038 §5): Studio's Site settings has a Collections section, one row per collection with the URL prefix before `/{slug}` and a real entry's address; saving goes through the site update, which writes the permanent redirect, and a path conflict shows on the row. The new MCP tool `set_collection_permalink` (`site:write`) moves a collection's URLs and always waits for a person, in every mode, with a prompt listing the old and new template, example entries' old and new URLs and the redirect; `dryRun: true` returns that plan without changing anything, and overlaps are refused before anyone is asked. `get_site` documents `collections`. `SiteGraphStore.updateSite(site, { dryRun: true })` runs every check without writing. A menu item for a collection links to a published page at the collection's permalink prefix when there is one, before the page that lists the collection. The blog starter's README describes collection permalinks. Only someone who may change site settings (`site:settings`) approves it: tool policies take a new `approverScopes`.

- 6612f2c: `cloudhal deploy` runs in Cloudflare Workers Builds (`WORKERS_CI=1`), so a Deploy to Cloudflare button can set up a whole installation (docs/guides/deploy-button.md). Names come from the committed `wrangler.jsonc`, and a database id there is used without any D1 call. The starter site is seeded under `cloudhal.json`'s `siteId` when the checkout has none. Secrets stay on the Workers: only missing ones are generated, and the deployment token is new on every build. The setup link is never printed; the first build explains how the owner sets their own setup token. `seedStarterSite` takes an optional `siteId`.
- 82fa917: Four surface gaps found while building interactive articles (RFC-0022, after 22e).
  - **Computed comparisons:** a `visible` condition or `if`'s `cond` takes a call as an operand, e.g. `{"lt": [{"call": "calculate", …}, {"call": "calculate", …}]}`, within the same nesting and call limits. `evaluateCondition` takes an optional `ResolveContext`.
  - **`Toggle` label:** a labelled Toggle shows its label as a `<legend>`, as RadioGroup does.
  - **`Table` columns:** `hideOnPhone: true` keeps a column (never the first) out of the phone card.
  - **`formatNumber`:** `minDigits` keeps trailing zeros (9.60).
  - **Runtime:** it is now `surface.11.js`; the earlier names keep working.
